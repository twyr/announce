#### WHY ANNOUNCE
Most node.js projects follow a fairly simple set of steps during development - bump the (semantic) version for the next release, commit code,
author a changelog, tag/release on Github/Gitlab (with release notes), and publish to the NPM Registry.

While there are several tools that help with each of these steps, they fall into one of two categories - they either perform only one of the steps,
or they try to do everything and end up being extremely complex. A good example of the first category of tool is [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version),
which takes responsibility only for bumping up the versions, and nothing else. On the other hand, tools such as [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release)
provide functionality (via plugins) to push not only to NPM, but also several other registries/endpoints - see [semantic-release plugins](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/HEAD/docs/extending/plugins-list.md)
for example.

For the [Twy'r Project](https://github.com/twyr), neither of these categories of tools is "exactly right" - they provide either too little,
or too much, functionality. The Announce CLI/Module tries to fill in that "sweet spot" - providing exactly the functionality required.

#### WORKFLOW
The [Twy'r Project](https://github.com/twyr) development/release workflow consists of the following steps:
1. Bump version as required
1. Create a changelog automatically before tagging
1. Generate release notes and create a Github/Gitlab release using the tag created in Step #2
1. Publish the release to NPM
1. Repeat for the next development/release cycle

Every repository in the project, including this CLI/Module, will adhere to this workflow going forward. The Announce module will be used
extensively to maintain the versioning, changelog, and release notes - as well as acting as a helper tool to publish to NPM as required.

#### USING THE CLI

##### CLI Installation
